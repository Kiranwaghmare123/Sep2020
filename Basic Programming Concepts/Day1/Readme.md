Java:<br>
•	General purpose Programming language.<br>
•	Supports OOP<br>
•	Developed by Sun Microsystems of USA in 1991<br>
•	Called  as OAK by James Gosling <br>
•	Discovered to overcome the limitations of C and C++ in terms of both reliability & portability<br>
•	Thus, Java a really simple, reliable, portable & powerful language.<br>

Java Features:<br>

1.	Compiled and Interpreted<br>
•	Computer language is either compiled or interpreted.<br>
•	Java combines 2 stage program<br>
i.	Compiler translates source code into bytecode.(Bytecod is not machine instruction, therefore 2nd stage)<br>
ii.	Interpreter generates machine code that directly executed by the machine i.e., running Java Program.<br>

2.	Platform Independent and Portable<br>
•	It can be moved from one computer system  to another , anywhere and anytime.<br>
•	Changes and upgrades in OS, processors and system resources will not force any changes in Java programs.<br>
•	This is the reason why Java has become more popular language for programming on Internet which connects different kinds of system world wide.<br>

3.	Object Oriented<br>
•	It is a true Object Oriented language.<br>
•	Almost everything in Java is Object.<br>
•	All program code reside in Object and Classes.<br>
•	It comes with an extensive set of Classes arranged in Packages.<br>
•	The Object model in Java is Simple and easy to extends.<br>

4.	Robust and Secure<br>
•	Robust - Java is a robust language.<br>
•	Provides many safeguards to ensure reliable code.<br>
•	Strict  Compile time and run time checking for data types.<br> 
•	Designed as Ggarbage collected language relieving memory management problems.<br>
•	Also incorporate Exception Handling to capture the series of errors and eliminates the risk of crashing the system.<br>
•	Security -  Issue when used with Internet. <br>
•	Fear for Threat of viruses and abuse of system,<br>
•	Java system verify all memory access, so that viruses communicated with an applet.<br>
•	Program cannot gain access to memory locations without proper authorization.<br>

5.	Distributed<br>
•	Designed as distributed language for creating applications on Network.<br>
•	It has ability to share both data and programs.<br>

6.	Simple, Small and Familiar<br>
•	Simple and Small- Many feature of C and C++ that are either redundant and unreliable code are not a part of Java.<br>
•	E.g., Pointers, Preprocessor headers, goto statements, Operator Overloading , Multiple Inheritance are eliminated.<br>
•	Familiarity -  To make the language familiar many features are modelled  on C/C++.<br>

7.	Multithreaded and Interactive<br>
•	Multithreaded- Multiple task simultaneously.<br>
•	No need to wait for the application to finish one task before beginning another.<br>
•	Java runtime comes with tools that support multiprocess synchronization and construct smoothly running interactive systeems.<br>

8.	High Performance<br>
•	Java performance is impressive for an interpreted language due to intermediate bytecode.<br>
•	Architecture is designed to reduce overheads during runtime.<br>

9.	Dynamic and Extensible<br>
•	It is capable of dynamic linking in new class libraries, methods and objects<br>
•	Native methods are linked dynamically at runtime.<br>

10.	Ease of Development<br>


How java is Considered as Platform Independent and Portable ?<br>
<br>
A. Java is considered as Portable because –<br>
Java is Considered as Platform independent because of many different reasons which are listed below -<br>
1.	Output of a Java compiler is Non Executable Code i.e Bytecode.<br>
2.	Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions<br>
3.	Bytecode is executed by Java run-time system, which is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br>
4.	JVM is an interpreter.<br>
5.	JVM accepts Bytecode as input and execute it.<br>
6.	Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run a program in a wide variety of environments because only the JVM needs to be implemented for each platform.<br>
7.	For a given System we have Run-time package , once JVM is installed for particular system then any java program can run on it.<br>
8.	However Internal details of  JVM will differ from platform to platform but still all understand the Same Java Bytecode.<br>
